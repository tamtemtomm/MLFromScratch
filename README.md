# Machine Learning From Scratch

Welcome to the ml from scratch repository! This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch in C. 
The goal is practice my skill with C by make an inference off popular machine learning algorithms because I am a such a chad like that

## Algorithms Implemented
1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/tamtemtomm/MLFromScratch/tree/main/1.%20linear_regression) : An implementation of the Linear Regression algorithm using gradient descent.
2. [KNN(K-Nearest Neighbor)](https://github.com/tamtemtomm/MLFromScratch/tree/main/2.%20knn) :  An implementation of KNN using `Iris.csv`.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1. GCC compiler (or any C compiler)
2. Standard C libraries

### Building and Running
Each folder contains its own set of instructions for building and running the specific algorithm. 
Please refer to the respective README files in each folder for detailed instructions.

## Contributing
